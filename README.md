Introduction to Parallel Programming class code

# Building on OS X

These instructions are for OS X 10.9 "Mavericks".

* Step 1. Build and install OpenCV. The best way to do this is with
Homebrew. However, you must slightly alter the Homebrew OpenCV
installation; you must build it with libstdc++ (instead of the default
libc++) so that it will properly link against the nVidia CUDA dev kit. 
[This entry in the Udacity discussion forums](http://forums.udacity.com/questions/100132476/cuda-55-opencv-247-os-x-maverick-it-doesnt-work) describes exactly how to build a compatible OpenCV.

* Step 2. You can now create 10.9-compatible makefiles, which will allow you to
build and run your homework on your own machine:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Homework Solutions added:

- Homework 1: Basic gray scale converting of the image
- Homework 2: Blurring an image. Implemented with shared memory use. Special cares are taken for boundary pixels.
